              <h2>How to Fix HTTP error code "404 page not found"</h2>
			  <p>A 404 error is an HTTP status code that means that the page you were trying to reach on a server couldn't be found on their server.</p>
<h4>Solution 1</h4>
			  <h5>Check the hidden .htaccess file!</h5>
			  <p>An HTTP 404 error can be caused by a problem with your Apache configurations .htaccess file. By deafault this file remains hidden in many systems so please enable show hidden files feature of your system  and do not forget to upload it to your server directory. Some host like namecheap skip it when file is hidden.</p>
              <p>Please extract <strong>htaccess_file_to_solve_404.zip</strong> to your project directory.</p>
<br><br>
			  <h4>Solution 2</h4>
			  <h5>Check the appache mod_rewrite enabled</h5>
			  <p>You can search on internet to enable appache mod_rewrite as per your machine type like Windows WAMP, Ubuntu  </p>
<br><br>
<h4>Solution 3</h4>
			  You may also, in addition to the above, if it does not work, have to change the htaccess override rule from the apache conf file (either apache2.conf, http.conf).

<br>

Change the "Override None" to "Override All"<br><br>
		<h4>Solution 4</h4>If you get an error stating rewrite module is not found, then probably your userdir module is not enabled.

			  <p>An HTTP 500 error can be caused by a problem with your Apache configurations. If you have scripts or CGI programs which are generating a 500 error, check to make sure they have permission to run in the directory where they are located.
